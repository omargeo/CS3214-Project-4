# CS3214-Project-4
A 64-bit Memory Allocator

The goal of the project is to build a small personal web server that can serve files, stream
MP4 video, and provides a simple token-based authentication API.
The web server should implement persistent connections as per the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
HTTP/1.1 is specified in a series of “request for comments” (RFC) standards documents
(RFC 7230-7237), though the earlier RFC 2616 provides a shorter read.
